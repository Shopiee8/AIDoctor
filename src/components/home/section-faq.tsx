        question: "What is the difference between an AI doctor and a human doctor on this platform?",
        answer: "AI doctors are advanced algorithms designed for initial consultations, quick check-ins, and managing health data. They provide instant, 24/7 support. Human doctors are board-certified specialists who provide in-depth diagnosis, personalized treatment plans, and empathetic care for more complex health concerns."
    },
    {
        id: "item-2",
        question: "How do I book an appointment?",
        answer: "Simply use the search bar to find a doctor (AI or human), view their profile, and select an available time slot. The process is quick, easy, and can be done in just a few clicks."
    },
    {
        id: "item-3",
        question: "Is my data safe with an AI doctor?",
        answer: "Absolutely. We use state-of-the-art encryption and adhere to strict privacy regulations to ensure all your personal and health information is kept secure and confidential, whether you're interacting with an AI or a human doctor."
    },
    {
        id: "item-4",
        question: "When should I choose an AI doctor versus a human doctor?",
        answer: "AI doctors are great for initial symptom checks, post-operative follow-ups, medication reminders, and general health questions. For complex symptoms, a new diagnosis, or if you prefer a personal connection, we recommend booking an appointment with one of our human specialists."
    },
    {
        id: "item-5",
        question: "Can an AI doctor prescribe medication?",
        answer: "Currently, our AI doctors can provide recommendations and manage existing prescriptions under the supervision of a human doctor. All new prescriptions must be issued by a licensed human healthcare provider on our platform."
